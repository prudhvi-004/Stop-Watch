# Stop-Watch

A stopwatch application using PyQt5 in PyCharm is a simple yet practical desktop program that allows users to start, stop, and reset a timer that counts upward from zero. PyQt5 provides the necessary tools for creating the user interface, including buttons (QPushButton), labels (QLabel), and timers (QTimer). The timer is configured to update at short intervals—typically every 100 milliseconds or 1 second—to simulate the ticking of a stopwatch.

The application logic involves using a QTimer that triggers a function at each tick to increment a counter variable, which represents elapsed time in seconds or milliseconds. This value is then converted into a formatted string (e.g., MM:SS or HH:MM:SS) and displayed on the label. Start, stop, and reset functionality is managed through button click events connected to respective handler functions that control the timer’s state and the counter.

Developed in PyCharm, this project benefits from the IDE's support for managing Python files, installing PyQt5 packages, and debugging the application in real time. A stopwatch application is an excellent learning project for understanding event handling, time-based updates, signal-slot mechanisms, and dynamic GUI updates in PyQt5.
